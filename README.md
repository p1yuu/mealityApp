# BugHunter

A lightweight bug finding tool focused on supporting security research and Bug Bounty workflow.

This repository started as a personal project but currently contains a placeholder structure. It is designed to eventually support tools and automation for helping bug hunters with reconnaissance, scanning, and vulnerability workflows.

---

##  Project Purpose

BugHunter is intended to be a developer/bug-hunter focused toolbox for:
- Security reconnaissance
- Bug finding and classification
- Integration with external tooling
- Bug bounty automation

This repo is currently empty or a scaffold; future work will implement targeted scanning workflows.

---

##  Features (Planned)

- Recon modules for endpoint discovery
- Integration hooks for vulnerability scanners
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Secure workflow support
- Visualization of findings

> *Note:* The current version on GitHub may be a scaffold or placeholder — features are planned and in development.

## Danger

Use at your own risk.

This project is **experimental** and **under construction**.  
It may produce incorrect results, fail silently, or behave unpredictably.

DO NOT use this tool in production environments.  
DO NOT rely on it for security assurance or compliance.

You are fully responsible for how you use this software.

##  Usage

Currently this project is a foundation. Once implementations are added, the standard approach would be:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p1yuu/BugHunter.git
cd BugHunter
# install dependencies
# run scanner / analysis
